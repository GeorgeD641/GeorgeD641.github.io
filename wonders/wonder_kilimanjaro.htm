<h4> THE AWE OF AFRICA </h4>
<center><p> Mount Kilimanjaro or just Kilimanjaro with its three volcanic cones, Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira, is a dormant volcano in Tanzania.<br>
It is the highest mountain in Africa, with its summit about 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) from its base, and 5,895 metres (19,341 ft) above sea level.<br>
The first people known to have reached the summit of the mountain were Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller, in 1889.<br>
The mountain is part of Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination.<br>
The mountain has been the subject of many scientific studies because of its shrinking glaciers and disappearing ice fields.</center>
