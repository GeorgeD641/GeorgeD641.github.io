<h4> IN CIVILIZATION 6 </h4>
<p>Crater Lake is a single-tile passable Natural Wonder in Civilization VI.
Crater Lake appears as a Lake on Plains or Tundra tiles. Its tile provides 4 <img src= "Civ6Faith.png"> Faith and 1 <img src= "Civ6Science.png"> Science, instead of the normal yields from lake tiles.
Crater Lake increases the Appeal of adjacent tiles by +2.

Like normal Lake tiles, Crater Lake provides Fresh water to adjacent tiles.
 Land Units also suffer a <img src= "Civ6Movement.png"> Movement penalty when they embark/disembark from Crater Lake's tile onto dry land.

In Civilization VI: Rise and Fall, discovering Crater Lake grants +1 Era Score, or +3 Score if the player is the first to do so.

<h4> THE DEPTH OF A WONDER </h4>
<center><p>Crater Lake is a crater lake in south-central Oregon in the western United States.
   It is the main feature of Crater Lake National Park and is famous for its deep blue color and water clarity.
    The lake partly fills a nearly 2,148-foot (655 m)-deep caldera that was formed around 7,700  years ago by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama.
     There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years.
      With a depth of 1,949 feet (594 m), the lake is the deepest in the United States. In the world, it ranks ninth for maximum depth, and third for mean (average) depth.
