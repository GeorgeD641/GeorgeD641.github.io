<h4> PAMUKKALE </h4>
<center><h6>"Near the Mesogis, opposite Laodicea, is Hierapolis, where are hot springs, and the Plutonium, both of which have some singular properties.
The water of the springs is so easily consolidated and becomes stone, that if it is conducted through water-courses dams are formed consisting of a single piece of stone."

  <h4> THE COTTON CASTLE OF HIERAPOLIS <h4>
  <p>Known as Pamukkale (Cotton Castle) or ancient Hierapolis (Holy City), this area has been drawing the weary to its thermal springs since the time of Classical antiquity.
    The Turkish name refers to the surface of the shimmering, snow-white limestone, shaped over millennia by calcium-rich springs.
    Dripping slowly down the vast mountainside, mineral-rich waters foam and collect in terraces, spilling over cascades of stalactites into milky pools below.
     Legend has it that the formations are solidified cotton (the area's principal crop) that giants left out to dry.
