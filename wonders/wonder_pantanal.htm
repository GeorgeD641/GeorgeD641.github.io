<h4> IN CIVILIZATION 6</h4>
<p>The Pantanal is a 4-tile passable Natural Wonder in Civilization VI.

  Each wonder tile provides 2 <img src= "Icon_Culture.jpg">Culture and 2 <img src= "Civ6Food.png">Food,
  instead of the normal yields from Marsh tiles.

<h4> BRAZIL'S BEST KEPT SECRET <h4>
<p>The Pantanal is a huge, gently-sloped basin that receives runoff from the upland areas (the Planalto highlands)
and slowly releases the water through the Paraguay River and tributaries.
 The formation is a result of the large, concave pre-Andean depression of the earth's crust,
related to the Andean orogeny of the Tertiary. It constitutes an enormous internal river delta,
in which several rivers flowing from the surrounding plateau merge, depositing their sediments and erosion residues,
which have been filling, throughout the years, the large depression area of the Pantanal.
This area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger Parana-Paraguay Plain area.

The Pantanal is bounded by the Chiquitano dry forests to the west and northwest, by the Arid Chaco dry forests to the southwest, and the Humid Chaco to the south.
The Cerrado savannas lie to the north, east and southeast.
The Pantanal has an average yearly rainfall of 1,000–1,400 mm (39–55 in), but is fed by the upper Paraguay River.
Its average temperature is 25 °C (77 °F), but temperatures can fluctuate from 0 to 40 °C (32 to 104 °F).
