<h4> THE EYE OF THE SAHARA </h4>
<center><h6>"Oddly, it appears not to be the scar of a meteorite but a deeply eroded dome, with a rainbow-inspired color scheme."

<h4> IN CIVILIZATION 6 </h4>
<p>The Eye of the Sahara is a 3-tile passable Natural Wonder in Civilization VI: Rise and Fall.
The Eye appears on Desert tiles. Each wonder tile provides 1 <img src= "Civ6Production.png"> Production, with a further 1 <img src= "Civ6Production.png"> Production and 3 <img src= "Civ6Science.png"> Science once the game reaches the Atomic era.
The Eye of the Sahara increases the Appeal of adjacent tiles by +2.

<h4> THE GOOD TIDINGS OF THE MOUNTAINS </h4>
<p>The Richat Structure is a deeply eroded, slightly elliptical dome with a diameter of 40 kilometres (25 mi).
The sedimentary rock exposed in this dome ranges in age from Late Proterozoic within the center of the dome to Ordovician sandstone around its edges.
The sedimentary rocks composing this structure dip outward at 10–20°. Differential erosion of resistant layers of quartzite has created high-relief circular cuestas.
Its center consists of a siliceous breccia covering an area that is at least 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter.

Exposed within the interior of the Richat Structure are a variety of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites.
The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and hydrothermally altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars.
According to field mapping and aeromagnetic data, the gabbroic rocks form two concentric ring dikes.
