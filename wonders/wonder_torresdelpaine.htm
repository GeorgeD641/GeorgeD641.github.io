  <h4> IN CIVILIZATION 6</h4>
  <p>Torres del Paine is a 2-tile impassable Natural Wonder in Civilization VI.
Torres del Paine may be found on Grassland, Plains, and Tundra tiles.
Its tiles provide +2 Appeal to adjacent tiles. Despite its appearance, Torres del Paine is not considered a Mountain in-game.

Torres del Paine doubles the base terrain yields of all adjacent tiles, though it does not modify the additional yields from resources, or from terrain features such as hills and forests. Tiles adjacent to multiple wonder tiles do not receive multiple instances of this bonus.

In Civilization VI: Rise and Fall, discovering Torres del Paine grants +1 Era Score, or +3 Score if the player is the first to do so.

  <h4> THE TIGER'S TEETH <h4>
  <p>The Pantanal is a huge, gently-sloped basin that receives runoff from the upland areas (the Planalto highlands)
  and slowly releases the water through the Paraguay River and tributaries.
   The formation is a result of the large, concave pre-Andean depression of the earth's crust,
  related to the Andean orogeny of the Tertiary. It constitutes an enormous internal river delta,
  in which several rivers flowing from the surrounding plateau merge, depositing their sediments and erosion residues,
  which have been filling, throughout the years, the large depression area of the Pantanal.
  This area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger Parana-Paraguay Plain area.

  The Pantanal is bounded by the Chiquitano dry forests to the west and northwest, by the Arid Chaco dry forests to the southwest, and the Humid Chaco to the south.
  The Cerrado savannas lie to the north, east and southeast.
  The Pantanal has an average yearly rainfall of 1,000–1,400 mm (39–55 in), but is fed by the upper Paraguay River.
  Its average temperature is 25 °C (77 °F), but temperatures can fluctuate from 0 to 40 °C (32 to 104 °F).
