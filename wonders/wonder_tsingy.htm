<h4> THE GREAT PINNACLES </h4>
<p>The Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park is a national park located in Melaky Region, northwest Madagascar.
The national park centers on two geological formations: the Great Tsingy and the Little Tsingy.
Together with the adjacent Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve, the National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Tsingys are karstic plateaus in which groundwater has undercut the elevated uplands, and has gouged caverns and fissures into the limestone.
Because of local conditions, the erosion is patterned vertically as well as horizontally.
In several regions on western Madagascar, centering on the park and adjacent Nature Reserve, the superposition of vertical and horizontal erosion patterns has created dramatic "forests" of limestone needles
