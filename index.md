The Pomeranian is a small dog from the northwest of Poland and quickly became one of the most expensive dog breeds to breed, maintain, and neuter. The reason for their great cost is the royals of the 18th century owning them, so they were seen as a symbol of wealth and power. In fact, Queen Victoria owned a particularily small Pomeranian dog, making the smaller breed more desirable. However, their playful, happy, and energetic qualities make them a well-worth dog breed to own, and their small size makes them accessible for small home families.
